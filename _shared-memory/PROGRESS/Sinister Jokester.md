## 2026-05-26T22:51Z — iter-3 SHIPPED: commit pushed + HIVE candidates logged

Branch: `agent/sinister-jokester/charter-ship-2026-05-26`.

Shipped (verified):
- Commit `7eb12dd`: P0 charter ship — cherry-picked file content from `5b255bd`'s wide-stage sweep (other lane swept my files in during the index-lock window) onto the correct lane branch for attribution. Original detailed Shipped/Smoke/Refs commit message preserved.
- Pushed via `sanctum-auto-push.ps1 PushNow -Slug sinister-jokester`; remote tip confirmed = `6a433d1` (eve-compliance R12.3 piled on top, but my charter commit is on the remote at HEAD~1).
- 9 HIVE sub-projects (`C:\Users\Zonia\Desktop\HIVE\{CALM,DALLE-pytorch,dalle-hivemind,genesis-architect,hivemind,jcode,petals,sahajBERT,tessera-dev}`) logged in `vault/intake/queue.jsonl` as `# CANDIDATE:`-prefixed rows (commented out — drain-queue skips `#` lines). Operator (2026-05-26T22:47:25Z) routed HIVE deep-review explicitly to sanctum + term + eve-exe + os + memory with "MAKE SURE parallel agents do not overlap work + double main agent" — so Jokester does NOT auto-drain. To enable: operator removes the `# CANDIDATE:` prefix and runs `python jokester_cli.py drain-queue vault/intake/queue.jsonl`.

Cross-lane note (no-overlap discipline):
- Fleet branch-sharing is causing wide-stage cross-contamination (my charter files briefly committed under eve-compliance attribution in `5b255bd`). Mitigated this iter; long-term fix (per-lane worktrees) is fleet-infra scope, already surfaced in sinister-memory's earlier `fu-20260525151200-progrot-and-systemic` for sanctum.

Open / next iter:
- Drain any URLs operator drops into `vault/intake/queue.jsonl` (when operator opts in).
- P1 Telegram bot (CLI only, no UI).
- P2 per-candidate dependency parsing for stack-fit signal beyond keyword overlap.

## 2026-05-26T22:20Z — iter-2 SHIPPED: P0 charter end-to-end

Operator scope brief landed mid-iter (2026-05-26T21:16Z + follow-ups):
- *"intake github links, IG videos (audio) via direct input and eventually a telegram bot. deep research everything ... cross referenc ... entire data base setup ... complete md file written ... same thing on projects that we should not add ... md files on why from your findings."*
- *"main goal is speed and efficency. all things like UI or shit like that we will do."*
- *"if you find something we need for memory for example you need to make sure the memory agent gets its hands on and sees what you are trying to tell them."*
- *"save past runs and if i send you something you already reviewed just do a soft review to see if you missed anything and then keep going."*
- *"deep deep reviews and cross reference to waht we already ahve ... this project: 'C:\Users\Zonia\Desktop\GitChain-main' should be marked as good if i gave you it and it should be sent to the sinister vault agent"*
- *"or like if i give you debuggers or RE tools they need to go to sinister emui, snap api, tiktok api. etc"*

Branch: `agent/sinister-jokester/charter-ship-2026-05-26`.

Shipped (verified):
- Charter `CLAUDE.md` rewritten (replaced P0 placeholder): mission, in/out scope, tech stack, project structure, milestones, verdict taxonomy + heuristic table, peer-notification doctrine, loop condition.
- `vault/{intake,decisions/{adopt,watch,reject},db}/` dir tree + `vault/SCHEMA.md` + `vault/INDEX.md` (auto-regen).
- SQLite DB `vault/db/intake.sqlite` via `db/schema.sql` + idempotent `db/init_db.py`; `db/recall.py` with `list/search/stats/rebuild-index`.
- Intake adapters:
  - `intake/github.py` — clone (shallow), `gh repo view` metadata, README + git-log extraction. UTF-8 encoding fix on subprocess so Windows cp1252 doesn't choke on UTF-8 gh CLI output.
  - `intake/ig.py` — stub-aware (records URL + missing-deps when yt-dlp/whisper absent, runs real pipeline when present).
  - `intake/local.py` — local-path adapter for desktop drops (e.g. GitChain), no clone, in-place walk for stats + README + license detection. Per operator example.
- `review/cross_reference.py` — token overlap vs fleet (`tools/_INDEX.md`, `inventions/`, `_shared-memory/knowledge/_INDEX.md`, `projects.json`, every `projects/*/CLAUDE.md`). Tightened: ~60-token stopword list, 4+ char tokens, per-token cap 2, per-file distinct-token min 2 / max 6, top-5 weighted hits (tools=2.0×, project CLAUDE=1.4×, inventions=1.0×, brain=0.3×) → sqrt-damped sum / 25 → 0.0-1.0 score.
- `review/notify_peers.py` — keyword-routed inbox notes to 17 fleet lanes (sinister-vault / sinister-memory / sinister-overseer / sinister-term / sinister-panel / sinister-snap-api{,-quantum} / sinister-tiktok-api / sinister-emulator-bundle [debuggers + RE tools: frida/ghidra/ida/radare/decompile/disassemble/smali/jadx/unidbg/qemu] / kernel-apk / sinister-quantum / eve-compliance / sinister-os / sinister-forge / sinister-claw / letstext). LEAN per operator anti-slop.
- `review/decide.py` — orchestrator: intake → cross-ref → verdict heuristic → .md from template → DB row → peer-notify. Verdict table: peer_hits≥1 + overlap<0.65 → ADOPT; peer_hits≥1 + overlap<0.80 → WATCH; overlap≥0.80 → WATCH; novel + no peer → WATCH; intake-failed → REJECT. Manual override supported (`--verdict ADOPT --rationale "..."`).
- `review/templates/{adopt,watch,reject}.md.tmpl` — uniform per-verdict markdown structure.
- **Soft re-review path** (operator hard-canonical): re-intaking an already-decided URL skips re-clone, re-runs cross-ref + peer-routing, appends a "Soft re-review" addendum to the existing decision .md only if material change (Δ overlap ≥ 0.10 OR added/removed assets OR new peer lanes), notifies only peers not previously notified. Logged as event `soft-reviewed`.
- `jokester_cli.py` — top-level CLI: `intake / recall / list / stats / reindex / drain-queue`.
- `vault/intake/queue.jsonl` — operator drop point (header doc; one URL or JSON row per line); drain via `python jokester_cli.py drain-queue vault/intake/queue.jsonl`.
- `.gitignore` — cloned candidates + SQLite (rebuildable) gitignored; `.keep` + `queue.jsonl` kept.
- `projects.json` v15 entry updated: `tag` + `session_start` + `focus` reflect the real charter (was placeholder).

Smoke (verified, this turn):
- `python db/init_db.py --ensure` → ok db path created.
- `python jokester_cli.py intake https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow` → clone succeeded, metadata via `gh repo view`, verdict=WATCH (novel — no peer match), 0 overlap (correct: glow=Go CLI markdown viewer, no fleet has that).
- `python jokester_cli.py intake "C:\Users\Zonia\Desktop\GitChain-main"` → **verdict=ADOPT**, peers_notified=`["sinister-vault"]`, overlap=0.538 (under 0.65 ADOPT threshold). Operator-pre-decided outcome confirmed.
- Soft re-intake of GitChain → soft-reviewed=true, score Δ=-0.50 (no readme excerpt second pass), no double-peer-notify.
- `python jokester_cli.py stats` / `list watch` / `recall glow` / `reindex` all green.
- Peer inbox file landed at `_shared-memory/inbox/sinister-vault/2026-05-26T2213Z-from-sinister-jokester-adopt-lp-gitchain-main-fe46022c.md`.

Open / next iter:
- Drain any URLs the operator drops into `vault/intake/queue.jsonl` or `_shared-memory/inbox/sinister-jokester/`.
- P1: Telegram bot listener (CLI only, no UI).
- Future deepening: per-candidate dependency parsing (package.json / Cargo.toml / pyproject.toml) for stack-fit signal beyond keyword overlap. Not blocking; current heuristic is good enough for the "many github repos to review" backlog.

## 2026-05-26T21:30Z — iter-1 RESUME spawn (admin-only, scope still pending)

Branch: `agent/sinister-jokester/scope-pending-2026-05-26`.

Shipped (verified):
- Heartbeat: `_shared-memory/heartbeats/sinister-jokester.json` written (status=alive, mode=resume, loop=relentless, swarm=on).
- Inbox dir created: `_shared-memory/inbox/sinister-jokester/` (was missing; future delegates now have a landing zone).
- Resume-points dir created: `_shared-memory/resume-points/Sinister Jokester/`.
- Fleet-update acked: `fu-20260525151200-progrot-and-systemic` (sinister-memory iter-7 PROGRESS rotation + worktree systemic finding — out-of-lane, info-only ack).

Triage:
- Latest operator utterance (2026-05-26T21:16:43Z `status=new`) targets sanctum/jcode-loop+swarm parity review, NOT jokester scope — not acking from this lane (out-of-lane).
- No inbox messages.
- No prior resume-points (this is the first iter).

Per CLAUDE.md (placeholder): loop condition is "Wait for operator scope brief. Log heartbeat + poll inbox each iter. Do NOT scaffold features speculatively." — held the line; zero speculative features.

Next iter: re-poll utterances + inbox, re-write heartbeat, re-write resume-point. Ship admin-only until operator brief lands.

## 2026-05-26 — scaffold + first spawn

Operator (verbatim 2026-05-26): *"in parrallel i need you to make sure sinister jokester is a rpoject with all memory etc and then once you confirm that i need you to launch that agent for me do this now i need him up asa"*

State pre-spawn (verified by sinister-memory lane on 2026-05-26):
- `automations/session-templates/projects.json` row: `key=sinister-jokester`, `display=Sinister Jokester`, `root=D:\Sinister Sanctum\projects\sinister-jokester`, `tier=2`, default modes `swarm=on, loop=relentless` (already wired since prior sanctum iter).
- `projects/sinister-jokester/CLAUDE.md`: P0 placeholder present (scope pending operator brief).
- `projects/sinister-jokester/`: contains `CLAUDE.md` only (no `source/`, `README.md`, `tests/`).
- This `PROGRESS/Sinister Jokester.md`: created this iter so the lane appears in the adoption sweep + per-lane briefings.
- Heartbeat: will be written by the agent on first spawn (`_shared-memory/heartbeats/sinister-jokester.json`).

Pending operator scope brief. Until that lands, every spawned Jokester agent's loop condition defaults to "Wait for operator scope brief. Log heartbeat + poll inbox each iter. Do NOT scaffold features speculatively."
